# Agents

Custom agent personas for specialized tasks.

## Structure

Each agent file should include:
- **Role** - What this agent specializes in
- **Personality** - How it communicates and approaches problems
- **Capabilities** - What it can do
- **Limitations** - What it should avoid

## Adding Agents

Create a new `[agent-name].md` file in this directory.

## Example Agents

- `code-reviewer.md` - Focused code review agent
- `architect.md` - System design and architecture
- `debugger.md` - Systematic debugging approach
