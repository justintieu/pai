## Worldview

### Live authentically, accept imperfection
I just live life as I think it should be. I make mistakes and that's just how it is - I'm human. This philosophy wasn't learned from any tradition, but friends have noted it aligns with wisdom across religions. Authenticity and self-acceptance aren't complicated.

## Principles

### Build on what works
Reinventing has value, but time is finite. Porting good ideas and building on top is practical. Don't rebuild from scratch when you can extend.

### Parallelize by default
Time is costly. Run things concurrently when possible. Sequential only when dependencies require it.

### Ship, fail fast, iterate
Working code over perfect code. Ship something, learn from what breaks, iterate. Progress beats perfection.

### Tools reduce friction
Automation should remove repetitive work. If you're doing the same thing twice, automate it.

### Determinism over magic
Keep systems predictable. Minimize hidden behavior. The goal is knowing what will happen before it happens.
