# Challenges

## Current Obstacles

- **Time** - primary constraint across all goals
- **Focus** - gets split across many projects due to time pressure
- **Context rot** - losing context when switching between projects; core reason for building PAI
- **MDD & Anxiety** - Major Depressive Disorder (recurrent, currently in remission) and anxiety; can affect energy and motivation during episodes

## Recurring Issues

- Many goals competing for limited time
- Context loss when returning to projects after time away

## Growth Areas

- To be discovered as patterns emerge

## Open Questions

- To be added as they arise
