# Mission

## Core Purpose

Driven by a compulsion to build and solve problems. Strong sense of personal responsibility - feels like "it has to be me." Would rather make something happen than wait for someone else to do it.

## Impact

Wants to make significant impact through building things that help people - whether that's tools like PAI, apps like the MapleStory companion, or consulting work helping SMBs with AI.

## Guiding Principles

- **Agency over waiting** - if you want something done, do it yourself
- **Build to help** - create things that improve people's lives
- **Ship and iterate** - action over endless planning
