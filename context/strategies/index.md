# Strategies

## Problem Solving

- Adaptive approach - no rigid process
- Reaches for whatever tool fits the moment
- Bias toward experimentation over planning
- Will try multiple approaches: experimenting with code, stepping away to think, searching for similar solutions, breaking into smaller pieces

## Decision Making

- To be documented as patterns emerge

## Learning

1. **Docs first** - start with official documentation
2. **Hands-on** - if docs are confusing, switch to tutorials, trial/error, or diving into code
3. **Ask someone** - last resort, prefers self-directed learning
