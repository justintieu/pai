# Voice

Voice samples and style learnings for authentic communication drafting.

## Purpose

This directory stores your writing samples so Atlas can draft messages in your authentic voice. The more samples you provide (across different contexts), the better the voice matching.

## Contents

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [samples/](samples/index.md) | Your writing samples with metadata |
| [style-learnings.md](style-learnings.md) | Edit patterns and explicit feedback |

## How It Works

1. **Import samples** via the voice capture wizard ("Set up my voice")
2. **Categorize** each sample (work/personal, formal/casual, platform)
3. **Draft messages** - Atlas selects 2-4 matching samples to guide voice
4. **Provide feedback** - Edits and preferences are captured for improvement

## Managing Your Voice

### Add Samples
- **Wizard:** "Set up my voice" or "Import writing samples"
- **Quick add:** "Add voice sample" to add one more

### View Samples
- "Show my voice samples" - See the catalog
- "What have you learned about my writing?" - See extracted patterns

### Edit Samples
- Navigate to `samples/` and edit any file directly
- Modify content, metadata, or categorization

### Delete Samples
- Remove the file from `samples/`
- Update `samples/index.md` to reflect the change

### Reset
- "Clear all voice samples" to start fresh
- Or delete all files in `samples/` manually

## Testing Voice

Ask Atlas to write something for you to test if voice matching feels authentic:

- "Write a thank you note as me"
- "Draft a quick follow-up email in my voice"
- "How would I say this: [content]"

If it doesn't sound right, you may need more samples or samples from different contexts.

## Minimum Samples

For effective voice matching:
- **Minimum:** 4-6 samples
- **Ideal:** 2+ work samples, 2+ personal samples
- **Mix:** Include both formal and casual examples
