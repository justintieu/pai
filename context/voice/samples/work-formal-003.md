Confidentiality and Data Protection
Core Security Principles
Confidentiality Standards All team members must maintain the highest standards of confidentiality and data security when handling client information. This includes technical data, business information, source code, and any other materials provided by or created for clients.

Protocol Compliance Strict adherence to all data security protocols outlined in this document is mandatory. Any deviation from these procedures must be pre-approved by [COMPANY] management and documented.

Client Relationship Confidentiality [COMPANY] maintains direct contractual relationships with all clients. These clients expect complete confidentiality between assigned software engineers, [COMPANY], and the client organization. Information sharing is restricted to authorized personnel only.

Work Attribution Requirements For specific client engagements, all code commits must be attributed to the company owner to maintain consistency with existing client relationships and expectations. This means all git commits, documentation updates, and code contributions must use the owner's identity in author fields and commit messages.

Implementation Requirements
Access Control
Authorized Personnel Only: Access to client systems and data is limited to specifically authorized team members

Secure Network Connection: All client system access must be conducted through Tailscale VPN connection

Authentication Protocols: Multi-factor authentication required for all client system access

Connection Verification: Verify Tailscale connection and proper network routing before beginning any client work

Data Handling
No Local Storage: Client data must never be stored on personal devices or non-approved systems

Encrypted Transmission: All data transfers must use encrypted channels

Access Logging: All client system access must be logged and monitored

Immediate Disconnection: Disconnect from client systems immediately upon completion of work sessions

Work Attribution
Commit Attribution: All git commits must be made using the company owner's identity (name and email)

Code Ownership: All code contributions appear as authored by the designated company owner

Documentation Consistency: Technical documentation and comments maintain consistent authorship

Quality Assurance: All work must meet both [COMPANY] and client quality standards regardless of actual contributor

Configure git identity to use company owner's name and email before making any commits

Review client-specific protocols before beginning work

Confirm understanding of commit attribution requirements

Verify access procedures and connection methods

Maintain compliance throughout the engagement

Ongoing Compliance
Regular security protocol reviews

Updated access credentials as required

Continued adherence to client relationship protocols

Immediate reporting of any compliance concerns

Non-Compliance Consequences
Failure to adhere to these data security protocols may result in:

Immediate removal from client projects

Termination of contractor relationship

Legal action for breach of confidentiality

Potential liability for security incidents
