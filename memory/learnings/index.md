# Learnings

Organized insights from work sessions. Each learning is a separate file for context efficiency.

## Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `technical/` | Patterns, solutions, technical knowledge |
| `process/` | Better ways of working |
| `mistakes/` | Things that didn't work and why |

## Recent

- `technical/2026-01-22-context-saving-pattern.md` - Process → Save → Summarize
- `process/2026-01-22-pai-architecture-flow.md` - core/ → ~/.pai → ~/.claude
- `mistakes/2026-01-22-editing-deployed-files.md` - Don't edit ~/.claude directly

## Usage

Load specific files as needed rather than reading everything. Use grep to find relevant learnings:

```bash
grep -r "keyword" ~/.pai/memory/learnings/
```
