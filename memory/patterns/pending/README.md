# Pending Rule Proposals

Rule proposals awaiting user review. Generated by pattern detection when 3+ similar learnings are detected.

## Proposal Format

Each proposal file follows this structure:

```markdown
# Rule Proposal: {title}

**Pattern ID:** {patternId}
**Domain:** {domain}
**Destination:** {destination}
**Auto-apply:** yes|no
**Generated:** {ISO timestamp}

## Proposed Rule

{The actual rule content to be added}

## Source Learnings

- learning-id-1: Brief description
- learning-id-2: Brief description
- learning-id-3: Brief description

---
**Actions:** Approve | Reject | Edit
```

## File Naming

```
{patternId}.md
```

Example: `technical-context-management.md`

## Workflow

1. Pattern detected -> proposal file created here
2. User notified (inline or session-end)
3. User runs `/pai review-rules`
4. On approve: Rule written to destination, proposal deleted, CHANGELOG updated
5. On reject: Pattern marked as rejected in index.json, proposal deleted

## Auto-Apply Rules

Low-risk patterns (naming, formatting) may auto-apply without explicit approval. These won't appear here - they're written directly.

See `core/hooks/src/lib/rule-compiler.ts` for the auto-apply allowlist.
