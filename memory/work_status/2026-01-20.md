# 2026-01-20

## Completed

- [x] PAI ikigai setup - filled out all context files (identity, mission, goals, challenges, preferences, strategies)
- [x] Removed broken `pai sync --check` hook from settings.json
- [x] Redesigned work status structure - daily files, monthly archival to `archive/YYYY/`
- [x] Created `pai-work-status` skill in repo (`core/skills/pai-work-status/SKILL.md`)
- [x] Moved `pai-ikigai` skill to directory structure (`core/skills/pai-ikigai/SKILL.md`)
- [x] Updated skills index in both repo and ~/.pai
- [x] Updated profile configs (work.yaml, oss.yaml) for directory structure
- [x] Updated personal-ai-infrastructure.md docs for directory structure
- [x] Fixed `pai sync --check` hook - added --quiet flag for silent operation when no pending items
- [x] Researched Daniel Miessler's PAI (23 skills) - used parallel agents for analysis
- [x] Created `pai-scout` agent - researches external PAI repositories
- [x] Created `pai-porter` agent - ports skills from Miessler's PAI to ours
- [x] Created `pai-reader`, `pai-logger`, `pai-editor` sub-agents for Atlas
- [x] Ported `pai-validate` skill - skill governance with create/validate/fix workflows
- [x] Ported `pai-research` skill - multi-source research (Quick/Standard/Extensive modes, parallel agents)
- [x] Ported `pai-council` skill - multi-agent debate system (4-7 agents, 3 rounds)
- [x] Ported `pai-firstprinciples` skill - Deconstruct → Challenge → Reconstruct methodology
- [x] Ported `pai-telos` skill - Life OS for goals, beliefs, lessons, alignment
- [x] Added `USE WHEN` trigger syntax to all skills (adopted from Miessler's PAI)
- [x] Synced all changes to both ~/.pai and kasanariba-ai repos

## Notes

- `pai sync --check` hook now uses `--quiet` flag - only outputs when there are pending items.
- Work status structure: current month files at top level, previous months archived by year.
- PAI skills naming convention: prefix with `pai-` (e.g., `pai-work-status`, `pai-ikigai`).
- **Caution**: `pai update --force` overwrites user content in ~/.pai with templates from core/. Don't use --force on files with user data.
- **Miessler's PAI vs Ours**: His is infrastructure-heavy (routing, voice, observability); ours is content-heavy (context, memory). We chose hybrid approach - adopt his best skills, keep our simpler structure.
- **USE WHEN syntax**: Adopted from Miessler - explicit trigger phrases in skill descriptions (e.g., `USE WHEN research, find out about, investigate`).
- **Parallel porting pattern**: Used 3 parallel Task agents to port council/firstprinciples/telos simultaneously - efficient for independent work.
- **Current skill inventory**: 7 skills (council, firstprinciples, ikigai, research, telos, validate, work-status).
- **Current agent inventory**: 7 agents (pai-assistant/Atlas, pai-reader, pai-logger, pai-editor, pai-scout, pai-porter).
