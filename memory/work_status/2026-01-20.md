## In Progress

- [ ] Test `UserPromptSubmit` hook for sync check (changed from `PreToolUse`/`Stop`)

## Completed

- [x] PAI ikigai setup - filled out all context files (identity, mission, goals, challenges, preferences, strategies)
- [x] Removed broken `pai sync --check` hook from settings.json
- [x] Redesigned work status structure - daily files, monthly archival to `archive/YYYY/`
- [x] Created `pai-work-status` skill in repo (`core/skills/pai-work-status/SKILL.md`)
- [x] Moved `pai-ikigai` skill to directory structure (`core/skills/pai-ikigai/SKILL.md`)
- [x] Updated skills index in both repo and ~/.pai
- [x] Updated profile configs (work.yaml, oss.yaml) for directory structure
- [x] Updated personal-ai-infrastructure.md docs for directory structure
- [x] Fixed `pai sync --check` hook - added --quiet flag for silent operation when no pending items

## Notes

- `pai sync --check` hook now uses `--quiet` flag - only outputs when there are pending items.
- Work status structure: current month files at top level, previous months archived by year.
- PAI skills naming convention: prefix with `pai-` (e.g., `pai-work-status`, `pai-ikigai`).
- **Caution**: `pai update --force` overwrites user content in ~/.pai with templates from core/. Don't use --force on files with user data.
