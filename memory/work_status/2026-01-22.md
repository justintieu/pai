## In Progress

## Notes

- `pai file write` is dangerous (overwrites entire file) - reserved for new file creation only
- Edit tool provides surgical modifications preserving existing content
- Cloud hosting: Oracle free tier or Hetzner CAX21 (~€7/mo)
- Voice: voip.ms + Asterisk + Whisper/Piper (~$3-5/mo)
- Car hands-free: "Hey Siri, call Atlas" via SIP trunk
