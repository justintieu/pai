## Completed

- [x] Refactored PAI agents to use CLI for reads, Edit tool for writes
  - Updated pai-reader, pai-logger, pai-editor, pai-assistant
  - Established new pattern: CLI reads are safe/quick, Edit tool writes are surgical/intelligent
- [x] Added ~/.pai/** and kasanariba-ai/** permissions to settings.json
- [x] Committed and pushed changes to kasanariba-ai repo

## In Progress

## Notes

- `pai file write` is dangerous (overwrites entire file) - reserved for new file creation only
- Edit tool provides surgical modifications preserving existing content
