# Frameworks Workflow

Create memorable visual frameworks and mental models with hand-drawn editorial aesthetics.

## Core Process

```
DEFINE -> DESIGN -> PROMPT -> GENERATE -> VALIDATE
```

## Framework Types

| Type | Structure | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 2x2 Matrix | Four quadrants, two axes | Trade-off analysis, categorization |
| Venn Diagram | Overlapping circles | Relationships, intersections |
| Pyramid | Hierarchical layers | Priority, foundation concepts |
| Conceptual Map | Connected nodes | Relationships, systems |
| Spectrum/Scale | Linear continuum | Degrees, ranges |
| Cycle | Circular flow | Recurring processes |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Define Structure

Identify:
- **Framework type**: Which structure best represents the concept?
- **Elements**: What goes in each section/position?
- **Labels**: Axis names, section titles, key terms
- **Key zone**: Which area/intersection is most important?

For 2x2 matrices specifically:
- What are the two axes?
- What does each quadrant represent?
- Which quadrant is the "optimal zone"?

### Step 2: Design Visual

**Aesthetic Goal**: "Smart conceptual diagram, but hand-drawn and visually interesting"

This means:
- Imperfect geometry (slightly wobbly lines)
- Variable stroke weights
- Organic shapes that maintain professional clarity
- NOT clinical precision, but NOT sloppy either

**Color System**:
- **Black (#000000)**: All framework structure (axes, lines, borders)
- **Deep Purple (#4A148C)**: Optimal zones or primary concepts
- **Deep Teal (#00796B)**: Contrast or secondary concepts
- **Charcoal (#2D2D2D)**: Text and labels

**Color Rule**: Use sparingly - subtle fills or accents, NOT solid color blocks

**Typography**:
- Titles: Elegant display font
- Labels: Clean geometric sans
- Annotations: Condensed italic for editorial voice

### Step 3: Construct Prompt

```
[Framework type] visualizing [concept]

Structure:
- [Describe axes/sections/elements]
- [Identify what goes where]

Hand-drawn conceptual diagram aesthetic:
- Imperfect geometry, slightly wobbly lines
- Variable stroke weight
- Professional clarity despite organic feel

Light cream (#F5E6D3) background
Black structural lines
Purple (#4A148C) subtle fill/accent for [optimal zone]
Teal (#00796B) for [secondary/contrast zone]
Charcoal text throughout

Typography:
- Display font for main title
- Sans-serif for axis labels and quadrant names
- Condensed italic for any annotations

Color is subtle accent only, not solid blocks
```

### Step 4: Select Aspect Ratio

| Framework | Typical Ratio |
|-----------|---------------|
| 2x2 Matrix | 1:1 |
| Venn (2 circles) | 16:9 |
| Venn (3 circles) | 1:1 |
| Pyramid | 3:4 |
| Conceptual Map | 4:3 |
| Spectrum | 16:9 |

### Step 5: Generate

Parameters:
- Model: Prefer models handling structured content well
- Resolution: 1024px minimum

### Step 6: Validate

**Structure**:
- [ ] Framework is immediately recognizable
- [ ] All elements/zones are present
- [ ] Labels are complete and positioned correctly

**Aesthetic**:
- [ ] Hand-drawn feel achieved
- [ ] Professional clarity maintained
- [ ] Not over-polished or clinical

**Color**:
- [ ] Primarily black/greyscale structure
- [ ] Accent colors used sparingly
- [ ] Key zone is visually highlighted

**Typography**:
- [ ] All text is legible
- [ ] Hierarchy is clear
- [ ] Labels are appropriately sized

**Purpose**:
- [ ] Concept is communicated at a glance
- [ ] Could serve as definitive visual reference
- [ ] Memorable and shareable

## Examples

### Example 1: Build vs Buy Matrix

**Type**: 2x2 Matrix

**Axes**:
- X: Strategic Importance (Low -> High)
- Y: Competitive Differentiation (Low -> High)

**Quadrants**:
- Low/Low: Buy commodity
- Low/High: Partner
- High/Low: Buy and customize
- High/High: Build (optimal zone - purple)

### Example 2: Product-Market Fit Venn

**Type**: Venn Diagram (3 circles)

**Circles**:
- What you can build
- What people want
- What people will pay for

**Intersection**: Product-Market Fit (purple highlight)

### Example 3: Technology Adoption Spectrum

**Type**: Spectrum/Scale

**Range**: Innovators -> Early Adopters -> Early Majority -> Late Majority -> Laggards

**Highlight**: The "chasm" between Early Adopters and Early Majority (teal accent)

### Example 4: Decision-Making Pyramid

**Type**: Pyramid

**Layers** (bottom to top):
- Data
- Information
- Knowledge
- Wisdom

**Highlight**: Wisdom layer (purple accent)

## Anti-Patterns

- Perfectly straight lines (embrace slight imperfection)
- Solid color fills (use subtle tints/accents)
- Over-complicated frameworks (keep simple)
- Missing labels (every zone needs identification)
- Clinical/corporate aesthetic (aim for editorial sophistication)
- Too many accent colors (stick to purple + teal only)
