# Align Workflow

Check consistency between beliefs, mission, and goals. Surface contradictions and opportunities.

## Process

### Step 1: Load Core Context

Read:
- `~/.pai/context/beliefs/`
- `~/.pai/context/mission/`
- `~/.pai/context/goals/`
- `~/.pai/context/strategies/`

### Step 2: Analyze Alignment

Look for:

**Strong alignment** - Goals directly express beliefs/mission
**Weak alignment** - Goals disconnected from stated values
**Contradictions** - Goals conflict with beliefs
**Missing expression** - Beliefs with no corresponding goals
**Unexpressed values** - Goals suggest unspoken beliefs

### Step 3: Present Findings

Frame as observations:
- "3 of 5 beliefs have no corresponding goals"
- "Mission mentions X, but goals focus on Y"
- "Goals suggest you value Z, but not in beliefs"

### Step 4: Ask Clarifying Questions

**Missing goals:** "Is this belief aspirational, or actively guiding you?"
**Contradictions:** "Temporary misalignment, or is one not accurate?"
**Unexpressed values:** "Should we add a belief about [X]?"

### Step 5: Identify Root Causes

Common reasons for misalignment:
- **Outdated beliefs** - Outgrown, should update
- **Aspirational but inactive** - Need goals to make real
- **Temporary sprints** - Fine if acknowledged
- **Competing priorities** - Need explicit choices
- **Incomplete articulation** - Values not written down

### Step 6: Suggest Adjustments

**Add goals** to express inactive beliefs
**Update beliefs** to reflect reality
**Reframe goals** to connect to mission
**Add missing beliefs** based on goals
**Mark temporary sprints** explicitly

### Step 7: Facilitate Hard Choices

Sometimes alignment requires choosing:
- Between competing beliefs
- Between belief and reality
- Between goals that compete for resources

## Alignment Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Fully Aligned | Beliefs expressed in goals, no contradictions |
| Temporarily Misaligned | Sprint/crisis, acknowledged as temporary |
| Needs Reconciliation | Gaps require conversation and updates |
| Needs Articulation | Living aligned but not documented |

## Example

**Assistant:** "I've read your beliefs and goals. Noticing:

1. Strong learning belief, but no skill development goals
2. Mission mentions building in public, but all goals are private projects
3. 8 work goals, 0 for relationships or health

Let's explore. Is learning a priority this quarter, or not right now?"

**User:** "I want to learn but haven't made space."

**Assistant:** "What if we added 'Complete one course by Q1'? Makes the belief actionable."

## Tips

- Frame gaps as observations, not judgments
- Temporary misalignment is fine if conscious
- Help distinguish "should believe" from "actually believe"
- Some contradictions are productive tensions
- Goal isn't perfect consistency, it's self-awareness
