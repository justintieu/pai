# Review Workflow

Assess progress on goals, identify what's working, and adjust course.

## Process

### Step 1: Load Current Goals

Read from `~/.pai/context/goals/`. Parse each goal's:
- Objective
- Why it matters
- Timeline
- Success criteria
- Last status

### Step 2: Check-in on Each Goal

Ask:
- "How's progress on [goal]?"
- "What's working well?"
- "What's blocking you?"
- "Is this still a priority?"

Listen for: wins, blockers, shifts, energy, clarity

### Step 3: Identify Patterns

Look across all goals:
- "4 of 6 goals blocked by time constraints"
- "Work goals progressing, personal stalled"
- "Goals without deadlines aren't moving"

Surface patterns to user.

### Step 4: Explore Adjustments

Suggest based on findings:

**Scope:** "Could you reduce scope to ship sooner?"
**Timeline:** "Do these dates still make sense?"
**Priority:** "If you could only achieve 3 of 7, which?"
**Resources:** "What would unblock [goal]?"

### Step 5: Capture Lessons

Ask: "What have you learned about yourself from this review?"

Offer to add as lessons to `~/.pai/memory/learnings/lessons.md`.

### Step 6: Update Goals

Based on conversation, offer to:
- Update status
- Adjust timelines
- Archive completed/dropped goals
- Add new goals
- Reorder by priority

Use Update workflow for changes.

## Review Types

| Type | Duration | Focus |
|------|----------|-------|
| Quick Check | 15 min | Status, blockers, priorities |
| Deep Review | 45 min | Patterns, alignment, lessons |
| Quarterly | 90 min | Full quarter, set next goals |

## Example Prompts

**Progress:** "Walk me through what you've done on [goal]"
**Blockers:** "What's preventing progress?"
**Energy:** "How do you feel when you think about this goal?"
**Clarity:** "How will you know when this is done?"

## Tips

- Start with wins to build momentum
- Frame blockers as problem-solving, not judgment
- Help distinguish "should want" from "actually want"
- Some goals should be dropped - that's healthy pruning
