# Setup Workflow

Guided setup for PAI context files through conversational questions. Helps articulate identity, mission, goals, beliefs, and strategies.

Inspired by ikigai (生きがい) - finding purpose at the intersection of what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for.

## When to Use

- First time setting up PAI
- Context files are empty or minimal
- User wants to reflect on and document their purpose or working style

## Approach

Rather than filling out forms, this is a guided conversation. Ask thoughtful questions, listen to responses, and help articulate things they may not have put into words before.

### Principles

1. **Start with identity** - Understanding who someone is creates context for everything else
2. **Move from self to purpose** - Identity → mission → goals
3. **Be conversational** - Ask follow-ups, reflect back what you hear
4. **Capture essence** - A few meaningful insights beat lengthy documentation
5. **Respect pace** - One section at a time or all at once

## Process

### Full Setup

1. Introduce the process - explain we'll explore identity, purpose, and working style
2. Guide through each area in order:
   - **Identity** - who you are, background, working style
   - **Mission** - core purpose, impact you want to have
   - **Goals** - current focus, short/long-term
   - **Beliefs** - core values, what guides you
   - **Strategies** - how you solve problems, make decisions
3. For each area, ask 2-3 thoughtful questions
4. Synthesize responses and write to the appropriate context file
5. Summarize what was captured

### Quick Setup

Focus on three essentials with one question each:

1. "How would you describe yourself and what you do?" → identity
2. "What's the impact you want to have?" → mission
3. "What are you focused on right now?" → goals

### Single Section

1. Identify which area to focus on
2. Read current content (if any)
3. Ask relevant questions
4. Update file, preserving existing content

## Ikigai Framework

For deeper exploration:

| Question | Maps To |
|----------|---------|
| What do you love? | identity, beliefs |
| What are you good at? | identity, strategies |
| What does the world need? | mission, goals |
| What can you be paid for? | goals |

**Guided questions:**
- "What activities make you lose track of time?"
- "What do people come to you for help with?"
- "What problems in the world bother you most?"

## Tips

- Let the user drive the pace
- Read existing files first to avoid overwriting
- Use the user's own words
- It's okay to leave sections empty - build up over time
