# Task Definitions Index

> **Auto-generated** - Do not edit manually. Run `lib/generate-task-index.sh` to regenerate.

This index provides metadata-only routing information for lazy loading.
Load the full SKILL.md only when actually invoking a task-def.

## Routing

When routing a user request:
1. Scan the **Triggers** column for keyword matches
2. If match found, read `~/.pai/task-defs/{name}/SKILL.md`
3. Spawn as Task agent with SKILL.md as prompt context
