# Essay Illustration Workflow

Create charcoal architectural sketch images for blog headers and editorial illustrations.

## Core Process

```
UNDERSTAND -> EMOTION -> COMPOSITION -> PROMPT -> GENERATE -> VALIDATE
```

All steps are mandatory for quality output.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understand Content

Analyze the content to identify:
- **Central theme**: What is the piece actually about?
- **Core problem**: What issue is being addressed?
- **Visual subject**: What should be depicted (NOT defaulting to buildings)

The architectural sketching **style** applies to whatever the content is about - people, objects, concepts, machines - not literal architecture.

### Step 2: Define Emotional Tone

Identify the emotional quality:
- Hopeful vs. cautionary
- Analytical vs. provocative
- Contemplative vs. urgent

This guides composition choices.

### Step 3: Design Composition

**Visual Problem Types** (choose based on content):

| Problem Type | Visual Approach |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Sorting/categorization | Objects being separated, filtered |
| Double standards | Contrasting treatments side by side |
| Misdirection | Attention being pulled in wrong direction |
| Hidden complexity | Layers being revealed |
| Scale mismatch | Size contrasts |

**Mandatory Colors**:
- **Burnt Sienna (#8B4513)**: Represents human warmth, must be present
- **Deep Purple (#4A148C)**: Represents technology/capital, must be present

If an image is missing either color, it's incomplete.

### Step 4: Construct Prompt

Build a detailed prompt including:

```
[Subject description - what is actually being depicted]
[Composition and focal point]
[Charcoal architectural sketch style with burnt sienna warmth and deep purple accents]
[Light cream (#F5E6D3) background]
[Three-tier typography if text needed: elegant serif headers, geometric sans labels, condensed italic annotations]
[Hand-drawn aesthetic with imperfect lines and organic forms]
```

### Step 5: Generate Image

Use AI image generation with these parameters:
- Model: Prefer models strong in artistic/sketch styles
- Aspect ratio: Typically 16:9 for blog headers
- Resolution: 1024x1024 minimum, resize as needed

### Step 6: Validate

Checklist:
- [ ] Subject depicts actual content theme (not generic buildings)
- [ ] Burnt sienna (human warmth) is visible
- [ ] Deep purple (technology/capital) is visible
- [ ] Hand-drawn charcoal aesthetic achieved
- [ ] Central problem is "visible at a glance"
- [ ] Cream background, not white
- [ ] Gallery-quality sophistication

## Examples

### Example 1: AI Job Displacement Article

**Content**: Essay about AI replacing human workers

**Composition**: Human figure in burnt sienna tones, hand outstretched, with purple mechanical/digital elements encroaching

**Prompt elements**:
- Charcoal sketch of human worker
- Burnt sienna warmth in human figure
- Deep purple geometric/mechanical elements
- Tension between organic and structured forms

### Example 2: Startup Funding Article

**Content**: Piece about venture capital dynamics

**Composition**: Scales or balance imagery with money/growth on one side, founder figure on other

**Prompt elements**:
- Charcoal sketch of balance/scales metaphor
- Burnt sienna in human/founder elements
- Deep purple in capital/money elements
- Power dynamic visible in composition

## Anti-Patterns

- Defaulting to literal building/architecture when content is about something else
- Using only one accent color
- Over-polished digital look (should feel hand-drawn)
- Generic stock-photo style compositions
- Missing the emotional core of the content
